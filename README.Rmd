# `simts` Overview <a href="https://smac-group.com/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" style="width: 20%; height: 20%"/></a>

The Time Series Tools (`simts`) R package provides a series of tools to simulate, plot, estimate, select and forecast different time series models. Its original purpose was to be a support to the online textbook ["Applied Time Series Analysis with R"](https://smac-group.github.io/ts/) but can obviously be used for time series analysis in general. More specifically, the package provides tools with the following features:

* Simulation of time series from SARIMA models to various state-space models that can be expressed as latent time series processes.
* Visualization of time series data with user specifications.
* Specific simulation and visualization tools for latent time series models.
* Easy-to-use functions to estimate and infer on the parameters of time series models through different methods (standard and robust).
* Diagnostic and statistical tools to assess goodness of fit and select the best model for the data.
* Estimating and plotting tools to deliver point forecasts and confidence intervals.

To understand the usage of the `simts` package, please refer to the "Vignettes" tab above.

## Install Instructions

## Installation

The `simts` package is available on both CRAN and GitHub. The CRAN
version is considered stable while the GitHub version is subject to modifications/updates which 
may lead to installation problems or broken functions. You can install the stable version of the
`simts` package with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("simts")
```

For users who are interested in having the latest developments, the GitHub version is ideal although more dependencies are required to run a stable version of the package. Most importantly, users **must** have a (C++) compiler installed on their machine that is compatible with R (e.g. Clang).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("RcppArmadillo","devtools","knitr","rmarkdown"))

# Install the package from GitHub without Vignettes/User Guides
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/simts")

# Install the package with Vignettes/User Guides 
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/simts", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

*The setup to obtain the development version of `simts` is platform dependent.*
